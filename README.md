>**NOTE**: In early December 2010, the BBC changed the way it serves content to the iPhone/iPod to use an HTTPS connection for part of the process. As a result this program no longer works.  More information on the nature of the change can be found [here](here).

iFetcher is a small utility written in C++/[Qt](https://www.qt.io/) that allows you to download unencrypted [BBC iPlayer](https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer) TV programmes to your local hard disk for later viewing.  This utility is particularly useful if your broadband connection is too slow to support video streaming. Downloaded TV programmes can be transferred to an [iPod](https://www.apple.com/ipod-touch/) or [iPhone](https://www.apple.com/iphone/) using [iTunes](https://www.apple.com/itunes/).

The utility program works by pretending to be an iPhone so only video material available for the iPod/iPhone can be downloaded.  In addition to this, the program is only usable in the UK since the BBC will check your IP address.  Please note that the links may not always work as programmes may not be available for any number of reasons.
